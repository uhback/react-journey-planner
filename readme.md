# Journey Planner

## Introduction
> This application is to make a own journey and share/interact the journey plans that other people posted.
> I'm using ReactJS with Redux and Webpack for the Front-end, and ASP.NET WebAPI is to use for the Back-end side.

## Main Includes
* React
* React-Redux
* React-router
* Webpack
* Axios : To get data by Json through the API calls
* Semantic UI : For design

## Notice
> This is only for the front-end side, so need to set the back-end side and modify the *actions* to call the api if you want to use it.
